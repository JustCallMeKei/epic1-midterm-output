🌟 About the design 🌟

⭐My design is inspired by the dreamcatcher logo even though I made it look like a lotus, I added twist by adding something similar to the Philippines.<br /> 
⭐ The 3 squares represented the 3 stars in the flag. The 3 circles which included the lotus symbol represented the colors of the PH flag, there is a 4th circle however that is colored pink because it's my dream that our president represented the color pink that is why I called my mandala Dream. <br />
⭐ The 8 circles represented the 8 rays of sun in the PH flag. <br />
⭐ Lastly the multicolored lines represented the different ethnicities of the country, the pink circle touches all ethnicity since I believe only she, who is sitting at the highest position in the country can unite every Filipinos. Even though we lost she can still run 3 or more times.<br />
